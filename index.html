    And by now, you should've somehow realised what you gotta do
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
    And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
    I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
    And all the roads we have to walk are winding
    And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
    There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how
    Because maybe
    You're gonna be the one that saves me
    And after all
    You're my wonderwall
    <br></br>
    Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
    And by now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
    And all the roads that lead you there were winding
    And all the lights that light the way are blinding
    There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how</p></div>
